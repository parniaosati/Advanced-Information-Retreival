    "Abstract": "Despite the huge research on crowd on behavior understanding in visual surveillance community, lack of publicly available realistic datasets for evaluating crowd behavioral interaction led not to have a fair common test bed for researchers to compare the strength of their methods in the real scenarios. This work presents a novel crowd dataset contains around 45,000 video clips which annotated by one of the five different fine-grained abnormal behavior categories. We also evaluated two state-of… ",

    "Abstract": "Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices and applications are being deployed in our homes and workplaces. These devices often rely on continuous data collection to feed machine learning models. However, this approach introduces several privacy and efficiency challenges, as the service operator can perform unwanted inferences on the available data. Recently, advances in edge processing have paved the way for more efficient, and private, data processing at the source for simple tasks and lighter models… ",

    "Abstract": "Unsupervised representation learning has proved to be a critical component of anomaly detection/localization in images. The challenges to learn such a representation are two-fold. Firstly, the sample size is not often large enough to learn a rich generalizable representation through conventional techniques. Secondly, while only normal samples are available at training, the learned features should be discriminative of normal and anomalous samples. Here, we propose to use the \"distillation\" of… ",

For this purpose, a grid of particles is placed over the image and it is advected with the space-time average of optical flow. By treating the moving particles as individuals, their interaction forces are estimated using social force model. The interaction force is then mapped into the image plane to obtain Force Flow for every pixel in every frame. Randomly selected… ",

That is, each pixel is represented using a linear combination of a few dictionary elements learned from the data, but since pixels inside a… ",

    "Abstract": "Abnormal detection in crowd is a challenging vision task due to the scarcity of real-world training examples and the lack of a clear definition of abnormality. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel measure to capture the commotion of a crowd motion for the task of abnormality detection in crowd. The unsupervised nature of the proposed measure allows to detect abnormality adaptively (i.e. context dependent) with no training cost. The extensive experiments on three different levels (e.g… ",

    "Abstract": "In this work we present a new crowd analysis algorithm powered by behavior priors that are learned on a large database of crowd videos gathered from the Internet. The algorithm works by first learning a set of crowd behavior priors off-line. During testing, crowd patches are matched to the database and behavior priors are transferred. We adhere to the insight that despite the fact that the entire space of possible crowd behaviors is infinite, the space of distinguishable crowd motion patterns… ",

Three properties are identified as important for the design of a localized video representation suitable for anomaly detection in such scenes: 1) joint modeling of appearance and dynamics of the scene, and the abilities to detect 2) temporal, and 3) spatial abnormalities. The model for normal crowd behavior is based on mixtures of dynamic textures and outliers under this model are labeled as anomalies. Temporal anomalies… ",

Unstructured crowded scenes are defined as those scenes where the motion of a crowd appears to be random with different participants moving in different directions over time. This means each spatial location in such scenes supports more than one, or multi-modal, crowd behavior. The case of tracking in structured crowded scenes, where the crowd moves coherently in a common direction, and the direction of motion does… ",

Unlike standard video descriptors that mainly employ low level motion features, e.g. optical flow, the HOT descriptor simultaneously encodes magnitude and orientation of tracklets as a mid-level representation over crowd motions. However, extracting tracklets in HOT suffers from poor salient point initialization… ",

Our work seeks a deeper analysis of social behavior by identifying the small group structure of crowds, forming the basis for mid-level activity analysis at the granularity of human social groups. Building upon state-of-the-art algorithms for pedestrian detection and multi-object tracking, and inspired by social science models of human… ",

    "Abstract": "We introduce a powerful student-teacher framework for the challenging problem of unsupervised anomaly detection and pixel-precise anomaly segmentation in high-resolution images. Student networks are trained to regress the output of a descriptive teacher network that was pretrained on a large dataset of patches from natural images. This circumvents the need for prior data annotation. Anomalies are detected when the outputs of the student networks differ from that of the teacher network. This… ",

However, reliably inferring user behavior and context from noisy and complex sensor data collected under mobile device constraints remains an open problem, and a key bottleneck to sensor app development. In recent years, advances in the field of deep learning have resulted in nearly unprecedented gains in related inference tasks such as speech and object… ",

    "Abstract": "Deep convolutional neural networks (DNNs) have brought significant performance improvements to face recognition. However the training can hardly be carried out on mobile devices because the training of these models requires much computational power. An individual user with the demand of deriving DNN models from her own datasets usually has to outsource the training procedure onto a cloud or edge server. However this outsourcing method violates privacy because it exposes the users’ data to… ",

    "Title": "Deep Semi-Supervised Anomaly Detection",
    "Abstract": "Deep approaches to anomaly detection have recently shown promising results over shallow methods on large and complex datasets. Typically anomaly detection is treated as an unsupervised learning problem. In practice however, one may have---in addition to a large set of unlabeled samples---access to a small pool of labeled samples, e.g. a subset verified by some domain expert as being normal or anomalous. Semi-supervised approaches to anomaly detection aim to utilize such labeled samples, but… ",

We characterise crowd behaviour by observing the crowd optical flow and use unsupervised feature extraction to encode normal crowd behaviour. The unsupervised feature extraction applies spectral clustering to find the optimal number of models to represent normal motion patterns.

As a result, the question of how wearables should evolve over the next 5 to 10 years is assuming an increasing level of societal and commercial importance. A range of open design and system questions are emerging, for instance: How can wearables shift from being largely health and fitness focused to tracking a wider range of life events? What will become the dominant methods through which users interact with wearables… ",

Here, we focus on the challenging task of monitoring crowded events for outbreaks of violence. Such scenes require a human surveyor to monitor multiple video screens, presenting crowds of people in a constantly changing sea of activity, and to identify signs of breaking violence early enough to alert help. With this in mind, we propose the following contributions: (1) We describe a novel approach to… ",

    "Title": "Iterative energy-based projection on a normal data manifold for anomaly localization",
    "Abstract": "Autoencoder reconstructions are widely used for the task of unsupervised anomaly localization. Indeed, an autoencoder trained on normal data is expected to only be able to reconstruct normal features of the data, allowing the segmentation of anomalous pixels in an image via a simple comparison between the image and its autoencoder reconstruction. In practice however, local defects added to a normal image can deteriorate the whole reconstruction, making this segmentation challenging. To tackle… ",
